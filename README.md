Smart Care Navigator is a Python-based project that leverages Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) to provide efficient hospital routing and smart appointment scheduling. This system is designed to address real-world healthcare challenges with speed, accuracy, and usability.

🔹 Features

Emergency Hospital Routing: Uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path to the nearest hospital during emergencies.

Priority-Based Appointment Scheduling: Manages patient appointments using heaps (priority queues) according to urgency levels: Emergency, Urgent, Standard.

Interactive Map Visualization: Displays hospitals, road networks, distances, and emergency routes dynamically.

User-Friendly GUI: Developed with Python Tkinter for smooth navigation and ease of use.

🔹 Technical Concepts Applied
